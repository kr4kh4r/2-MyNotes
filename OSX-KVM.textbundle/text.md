# OSX-KVM

### Requirements<!-- {"fold":true} -->

 
* A modern Linux distribution. E.g. Ubuntu 24.04 LTS 64-bit or later.

* QEMU >= 8.2.2

* A CPU with Intel VT-x / AMD SVM support is required (`grep -e vmx -e svm /proc/cpuinfo`)

* A CPU with SSE4.1 support is required for >= macOS Sierra

* A CPU with AVX2 support is required for >= macOS Ventura

â €
Note: Older AMD CPU(s) are known to be problematic but modern AMD Ryzen processors work just fine (even for macOS Sonoma).

### Installation Preparation<!-- {"fold":true} -->

 
* Install QEMU and other packages.

```
sudo apt-get install qemu-system uml-utilities virt-manager git \
    wget libguestfs-tools p7zip-full make dmg2img tesseract-ocr \
    tesseract-ocr-eng genisoimage vim net-tools screen -y
```

* This step may need to be adapted for your Linux distribution.

* Clone this repository on your QEMU system. Files from this repository are used in the following steps.

```
cd ~

git clone --depth 1 --recursive https://github.com/kholia/OSX-KVM.git

cd OSX-KVM
```

* Repository updates can be pulled via the following command:

```
git pull --rebase
```

* This repository uses rebase based workflows heavily.

* KVM may need the following tweak on the host machine to work.

```
sudo modprobe kvm; echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/module/kvm/parameters/ignore_msrs
```

* To make this change permanent, you may use the following command.

```
sudo cp kvm.conf /etc/modprobe.d/kvm.conf  # for intel boxes only

sudo cp kvm_amd.conf /etc/modprobe.d/kvm.conf  # for amd boxes only
```

* Add user to the `kvm` and `libvirt` groups (might be needed).

```
sudo usermod -aG kvm $(whoami)
sudo usermod -aG libvirt $(whoami)
sudo usermod -aG input $(whoami)
```

* Note: Re-login after executing this command.

* Fetch macOS installer.

```
./fetch-macOS-v2.py
```

* You can choose your desired macOS version here. After executing this step, you should have the `BaseSystem.dmg` file in the current folder.

* ATTENTION: Let `>= Big Sur` setup sit at the `Country Selection` screen, and other similar places for a while if things are being slow. The initial macOS setup wizard will eventually succeed.

* Sample run:

```
$ ./fetch-macOS-v2.py
1. High Sierra (10.13)
2. Mojave (10.14)
3. Catalina (10.15)
4. Big Sur (11.7)
5. Monterey (12.6)
6. Ventura (13) - RECOMMENDED
7. Sonoma (14)

Choose a product to download (1-7): 6
```

* Note: Modern NVIDIA GPUs are supported on HighSierra but not on later versions of macOS.

* Convert the downloaded `BaseSystem.dmg` file into the `BaseSystem.img` file.

```
dmg2img -i BaseSystem.dmg BaseSystem.img
```

* Create a virtual HDD image where macOS will be installed. If you change the name of the disk image from `mac_hdd_ng.img` to something else, the boot scripts will need to be updated to point to the new image name.

```
qemu-img create -f qcow2 mac_hdd_ng.img 256G
```

* NOTE: Create this HDD image file on a fast SSD/NVMe disk for best results.

* Now you are ready to install macOS ðŸš€

â €
### Installation

 
* CLI method (primary). Just run the `OpenCore-Boot.sh` script to start the installation process.

```
./OpenCore-Boot.sh
```

* Note: This same script works for all recent macOS versions.

* Use the `Disk Utility` tool within the macOS installer to partition, and format the virtual disk attached to the macOS VM. Use `APFS` (the default) for modern macOS versions.

* Go ahead, and install macOS ðŸ™Œ

* (OPTIONAL) Use this macOS VM disk with libvirt (virt-manager / virsh stuff).

  * Edit `macOS-libvirt-Catalina.xml` file and change the various file paths (search for `CHANGEME` strings in that file). The following command should do the trick usually.

```
sed "s/CHANGEME/$USER/g" macOS-libvirt-Catalina.xml > macOS.xml

virt-xml-validate macOS.xml
```

	* Create a VM by running the following command.

```
virsh --connect qemu:///system define macOS.xml
```

	* If needed, grant necessary permissions to libvirt-qemu user,

```
sudo setfacl -m u:libvirt-qemu:rx /home/$USER
sudo setfacl -R -m u:libvirt-qemu:rx /home/$USER/OSX-KVM
```

	* Launch `virt-manager` and start the `macOS` virtual machine.

â €
### Headless macOS<!-- {"fold":true} -->

 
* Use the provided [boot-macOS-headless.sh](https://github.com/kholia/OSX-KVM/blob/master/boot-macOS-headless.sh) script.

```
./boot-macOS-headless.sh
```

### Setting Expectations Right<!-- {"fold":true} -->

 
Nice job on setting up a `Virtual Hackintosh` system! Such a system can be used for a variety of purposes (e.g. software builds, testing, reversing work), and it may be all you need, along with some tweaks documented in this repository.

However, such a system lacks graphical acceleration, a reliable sound sub-system, USB 3 functionality and other similar things. To enable these things, take a look at our [notes](https://github.com/kholia/OSX-KVM/blob/master/notes.md). We would like to resume our testing and documentation work around this area. Please [reach out to us](mailto:dhiru.kholia@gmail.com?subject=%5BGitHub%5D%20OSX-KVM%20Funding%20Support) if you are able to fund this area of work.

It is possible to have 'beyond-native-apple-hw' performance but it does require work, patience, and a bit of luck (perhaps?).

### Post-Installation

 
* See [networking notes](https://github.com/kholia/OSX-KVM/blob/master/networking-qemu-kvm-howto.txt) on how to setup networking in your VM, outbound and also inbound for remote access to your VM via SSH, VNC, etc.

* To passthrough GPUs and other devices, see [these notes](https://github.com/kholia/OSX-KVM/blob/master/notes.md#gpu-passthrough-notes).

* Need a different resolution? Check out the [notes](https://github.com/kholia/OSX-KVM/blob/master/notes.md#change-resolution-in-opencore) included in this repository.

* Trouble with iMessage? Check out the [notes](https://github.com/kholia/OSX-KVM/blob/master/notes.md#trouble-with-imessage) included in this repository.
